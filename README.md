## Rules and Stuff

### Genre: Fighting game
Back story: Anime characters have taken over the world. Your goal is to defeat a number of anime characters with your clever strategizing and otaku knowledge. Not an otaku? Don't watch much anime? Never fear. This game provides the perfect excuse for you to binge watch anime series in the name of saving the world. 

### Goal: 
You need to defeat each anime character in each round (there are only 2 rounds). These characters get increasingly difficult but are between you and the salvation of the world. 

### Mechanics: 
You will have generic moves to use, such as punch and kick which are executed through the keyboard input. For each character you are up against,there will also be moves and options specific to that round that you can use (and may often deliver a fatal or round-winning move). These are effectively the cheat codes. These special abilities will have corresponding keyboard input shortcuts and are characteristic of the anime character. Abilities and shortcuts will be displayed in the instruction scene that appears as the one of the first things you see before playing the game. 

### How its levels or modes differ: 
Round 1 is a straight on battle round with the same attacks and simple up and down movement on the part of the opponent. Round 2, however, will contain a much more powerful opponent that moves more sporadically and is more difficult to defeat.

### How to play:
Your goal is to defeat a 2 anime characters (1 per round) with your clever strategizing and otaku knowledge. Both you and your opponent have 50 life points. Whoever reaches 0 first loses. To defeat your opponent, you can throw weapons at them, jump on them, or leverage your special abilities detailed later. Meanwhile the opponent can and will continuously throw weapons at you. Furthermore, if you get too close to an opponent (near overlapping), they will go berserk and cause you to lose life points. Your opponents are not the most stable of beings. You have been warned. 

#### Keyboard codes
1. You may use the arrow keys to move around in the game.
2. Shift: Spirit Summoner causes the opponent lose 7 life points. You can only use this 4 times.
3. J: Jump. Jumping on the opponent causes it to lose 5 points each time. You have to be touching or overlapping the opponent in order for the jump to cause the opponent to lose points.
4. G: Green thumb allows Totoro to grow any produce (ie. fruits and vegetables). This move is a wild card. Technically it costs the opponent 50 life points, depending on the villain, it may have a different effect.
5. C: Cuteness/Friendly Neighbor. This move is also a wild card depending on the villain. It might help, it might not, but it does not directly cause the loss of an opponent's life points.
6. T: Hit/Throw. You can throw mini Totoros at your enemy. On-target throws cause the opponent to lose life points. You have a limit of 10 throws. 

To sum up: 
1. There are keyboard shortcuts that you use to execute attacks and move around.
2. If you get too close to the enemy, you will likely die.
3. Some of the keyboard shortcuts' effects depend on who the opponent is.

## How To Win (Cheat codes)
### Round 1: 
Press the keyboard letter G
### Round 2: 
Press the keyboard letter C. After that, you just have to win, which is quite easy. Hit the shift key until all of your spirit summons are up. Then hit the T key until all of your throws are up. This should defeat the enemy and cause it to lose all of its life points before it manages to kill you (that is, if you do it fast enough).
