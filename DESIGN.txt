Genre: Fighting game
Back story: Anime characters have taken over the world. Your goal is to defeat a number of anime characters with your clever
strategizing and otaku knowledge. Not an otaku? Don't watch much anime? Never fear. This game provides the perfect excuse for you to 
binge watch anime series in the name of saving the world. 

Goal: You need to defeat each anime character in each round (there are only 2 rounds). These characters get increasingly difficult 
but are between you and the salvation of the world. 

Mechanics: You will have generic moves to use, such as punch and kick which are executed through the keyboard input. For each 
character you are up against,there will also be moves and options specific to that round that you can use (and may often deliver a 
fatal or round-winning move). These are effectively the cheat codes. These special abilities will have corresponding keyboard input shortcuts and are characteristic of 
the anime character. Abilities and shortcuts will be displayed in the instruction scene that appears as the one of the first things you see 
before playing the game. 

How its levels or modes differ: Round 1 is a straight on battle round with the same attacks and cheat codes specified in the 
instructions. Round 2, however, will be highly explicit in how to defeat the opponent, and the player will have to achieve that 
specific task or mission. In round 2, the player will have to fight the opponent while also dodging attacks from anime character 
minions. 

You have a total of 10 hits.
